        Labels help you build a comprehensive and intuitive ontology that mirrors your organization. They are categorized through collections: each collection represents a functional area, while each label represent the variations that can occur within such area.
        For example, a typical ontology in a community-driven business would be: Roles as Label collection 1, Interests Groups as Label collection 2, Skills as Label collection 3
